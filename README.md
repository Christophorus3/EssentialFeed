# EssentialFeed

[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/Christophorus3/EssentialFeed.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/Christophorus3/EssentialFeed)

Work from iOS Lead Essentials course.

This is a basic example of how to implement a News Feed or Item Feed with a TDD approach. All Tests are written first, failing. Then the implementation is added, only what is needed to make the tests pass.

This is built using Travis CI.
