# EssentialFeed

[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/Christophorus3/EssentialFeed.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/Christophorus3/EssentialFeed)

Work from iOS Lead Essentials course.

This is a basic example of how to implement a News Feed or Item Feed with a TDD approach. All Tests are written first, failing. Then the implementation is added, only what is needed to make the tests pass.

This is built using Travis CI.


## Image Feed Feature Specs

### Story: Customer requests to see their image feed

### Narrative #1

```
As an online customer
I want the app to automatically load my latest image feed
So I can always enjoy the newest images of my friends
```

#### Scenarios (Acceptance criteria)

```
Given the customer has connectivity
 When the customer requests to see their feed
 Then the app should display the latest feed from remote
  And replace the cache with the new feed
```

### Narrative #2

```
As an offline customer
I want the app to show the latest saved version of my image feed
So I can always enjoy images of my friends
```

#### Scenarios (Acceptance criteria)

```
Given the customer doesn't have connectivity
  And there’s a cached version of the feed
  And the cache is less than seven days old
 When the customer requests to see the feed
 Then the app should display the latest feed saved

Given the customer doesn't have connectivity
  And there’s a cached version of the feed
  And the cache is seven days old or more
 When the customer requests to see the feed
 Then the app should display an error message

Given the customer doesn't have connectivity
  And the cache is empty
 When the customer requests to see the feed
 Then the app should display an error message
```

## UX Goals for Feed UI experience
- [x] Load Feed automatically when view is presented
- [x] Allow customer to manually reload feed (pull to refresh)
- [x] Show a loading indicator while loading feed
- [ ] Render all loaded feed itmes (location, image, description)
- [ ] Image loading experience
	- [ ] Load when image view is visible (on screen)
	- [ ] Cancel when image view is out of screen
	- [ ] Show a loading indicator while loading image (shimmer)
	- [ ] Option to retry on image download error
	- [ ] Preload when image view is near visible
